# my note for Udacity's [parallel programming](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs344)

When I was done with hearing [CS224n](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) and [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) of stadford through Youtube.

I thought I need to what the parallel programming, So I finally found out a certain lecture about parallel programming. 

That is [Udacity's cs344](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs344) 

In here, whenever I have time to take the cource above, I would take a note about the class I take in this repository.

To sum up, this repository is for the contents I have written on [hyunyoung2's note](https://hyunyoung2.github.io/my-note-for-parallel-programming-at-Udacity/) for parallel programming.
